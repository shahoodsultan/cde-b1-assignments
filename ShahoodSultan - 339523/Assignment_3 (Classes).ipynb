    "Create a base class Transport with a method travel() that prints a generic travel message.\n",

    "Create three subclasses:\n",
    "Bus – Represents intercity travel (e.g., Daewoo Express)\n",
    "Train – Represents railway travel (e.g., Pakistan Railways)\n",
    "Airplane – Represents air travel (e.g., PIA – Pakistan International Airlines)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subclass should override the travel() method to display unique travel details like the mode of transport, speed, and common use cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Explanation:**\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different subclasses (Bus, Train, Airplane) to be treated as objects of a common superclass (Transport).\n",
    "Each subclass provides a specific implementation of the travel() method.\n",
    "The function plan_trip() ensures that the correct version of the method is executed, even though it does not know the exact subclass beforehand.\n",

    "*   If he chooses Pakistan Railways Train, the method provides information about train schedules and cabins.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If he selects PIA Airplane, the method highlights flight duration, security checks, and ticket prices.\n",

    "Design an abstract class ECommercePlatform that represents an online shopping system.\n",

    "    - login() – For user authentication.\n",
    "    - add_to_cart() – To add products to the shopping cart.\n",
    "    - make_payment() – To handle payments.\n",

    "Abstraction hides the implementation details and provides a blueprint for derived classes through abstract methods.\n",
    "The abstract class ECommercePlatform ensures that every derived platform (Daraz, Foodpanda) implements key functionalities like login, add_to_cart, and make_payment.\n",
